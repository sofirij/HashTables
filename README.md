This was another assignment that I found meanial to do by hand and I saw a lot of traffic go to my graph sort so I decided to share this here.
I used simple hash techniques to create the hashtable so I just had to display it wisely and copy the table to make it seem like I typed it out by hand. (Now that's some application of CS right?)

## The Flow
Creating a hashtable to hash according to the manner stated in the problem and display the hashtable at each iteration (except for the separate chaining problem where I have to display the final table only)
